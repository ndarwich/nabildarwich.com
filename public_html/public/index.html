            <div class="home-featured-subtitle">
              One of my favorite courses in GMU's Computer Science Master's program is
              CS 672 (Computer Systems Performance Evaluation). By taking this course,
              I have learned very important laws that govern how computers are expected
              to behave. Computer systems do not behave arbitrarily; if a computer is slow,
              there is a physical reason why it is so, and that reason very likely is that
              a computer resource (be it hardware components or software regions) is being
              heavily utilized. Now, on a small scale, such as having a slow personal laptop,
              an individual can simply replace the laptop with a newer one and expect it to be faster.
              That individual is myself after I grew tired of a very slow 2-core 1 TB HDD laptop I
              abused during my undergrad, purchasing a new laptop in December 2017 that I use to this day. I invested more than $800
              on this laptop, and it has a 512 GB SSD and a 2.6 GHz 4-core i7-6700HQ processor. It's
              fast. Very fast. Back to the lesson; on a large scale, this idea works as well, but a lot more
              than $800 is going to be involved. And that is why I founded Nabil's Books.

                In the summer of 2018, I paid a visit to the West Coast. While I was
                there, I came across many things I never anticipated, and I also took many photos.
                Here are a few of these images:
