            <div class="home-featured-subtitle">
              One of my favorite GMU Computer Science graduate courses is
              CS 672 (Computer Systems Performance Evaluation). By taking this course,
              I have learned very important laws that govern how computers are expected
              to behave. Computer systems do not behave arbitrarily; if a computer is slow,
              there is a physical reason why it is so, whether it's hardware or thread contention.
              On a small scale, the solution is rather trivial: just get
              a new computer with better specs. On a large scale, an executive decision that
              may incur a lot of costs has to be made. The class explores multiple case studies
              that involve this decision making, and for my course project, I created a website for a fictional online
              bookstore.

                  <a href="/books">Nabil's Books</a> is a world-renowned bookstore that serves knowledge to millions of people.
                  Knowledge comes in many file formats, and Nabil's books sells Text Books (.txt), Image Books (.png), Audio Books
                  (.mp3), Video Books (.mp4), and Miscellaneous Books (.zip/.ppt/.pdf). In order to boost customer satisfaction,
                  Nabil wants to ensure that consumers are getting the service they expect in a timely manner. And so, an executive
                  decision has to be made regarding whether to purchase more CPUs or more Disks for the server that hosts Nabil's Books.

                In the summer of 2018, I paid a visit to the West Coast. While I was
                there, I came across many things I never anticipated, and I also took many photos.
                Here are a few of these images:
