          I'm Nabil Darwich, a student eager to learn. As a brief non-technical
          background of me, I like exploring new places and living spontaneously.
          In my free time, when it's nice outside, I like to go out and either exercise
          or meet up with my friends. Otherwise, I stay indoors and write code
          while enjoying some calm music, or sometimes I watch very popular older
          movies. My favorite aspect of a movie is its takeaway, but I also enjoy some
          dark sarcastic comedy from time to time. That's why some of my favorite
          movies include Blade Runner (1984) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994).
          My favorite music, as of now, is rock music, with bands like Dire Straits
          and Guns N' Roses topping my list. Albums like Brothers in Arms (1985) are
          just perfect. To learn more about me, visit the <a href="/bio">Bio</a>

        <div class="home-text-container">
          I'm a software developer, meaning I write code to create useful computer
          programs. The programs I develop range from ones that allow for robot
          movement with keyboard arrows to this very website. My intent when
          writing software is innovation. I want to solve unsolved problems and
          build things that have never been built before. But most importantly,
          I want each program I make to have a purpose. Whether it is
          to refresh my knowledge or help address a world problem, I use each
          program as a step forward towards my goal of being innovative and
          selfless. That being said, writing code is my passion, and it is
          what keeps me productive. To view samples of my published works, you
          can visit the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab of this site.

          <h2 class="home-title">Why do I do it?</h2>
          <div class="home-text-container">
            The reason I stay involved in Computer Science is that with it, there
            is no limit; I can develop things as far as my imagination goes. That's
            right, the sky used to be a limit, but we managed to surpass it,
            sent a man to the moon, and even a car to Mars, because why not?
            Now we are able to pack 100 million transistors in a square millimeter,
            and that number is only going to double every 18 months. We are also
            advancing in quantum computer research, with the devices having the
            potential to solve problems we never thought possible.
            <h3>Do I have any setbacks?</h3>
            Of course, there are many days where I ask myself whether or not this
            was the right decision to make. Those days are especially frequent
            when I dedicate hours of my time dealing with an issue that could have
            been solved in 10 lines of code. Some days, I think about the negative
            effects Computer Science had on my social life and physical health,
            such as choosing to spend more time coding over friends, and not
            exercising as I optimally should, and that leads me deeper down the
            hole of regretting my decision to choose Computer Science.
            <h3>Why do I still do it?</h3>
            Because there is a lot of gratification in having an innovation that
            you engineered that does work and solves the problem you were trying
            to solve. Computer Science is an engineering field made for innovation,
            and innovation is what leads to human progress and development. I aim
            to be an innovator, and want to solve major problems the world is facing.
            The world is great thanks to innovators, from those who discovered how
            to make and manipulate fires, to recent pioneers like Thomas Edison
            and the late great Sanjeev Setia.

        <h2 class="home-title">How do I do it?</h2>
        <div class="home-text-container">
          Prior to starting my undergrad, I had no experience writing code. In
          fact, the only reason why I decided to study Computer Science at the time was for
          the simple fact that I loved messing around with computers, and I
          was my family's free tech support specialist. So, I chose Computer Science as my major and
          took at least 3 courses every semester that are relevant to the field
          and are designated to build up my knowledge. After my first successful
          year, I wanted to give back, and help students just like I was helped
          when I was new to the field. So, I applied to become a teaching assistant,
          and made it in the department! My first semester as a teaching assistant
          was invaluable, as I had over 1,500 contributions in the shared online
          forum, and I made unforgettable friendships with the students I helped.
          That spirit of selflessness was very rewarding, as it helped me refresb my
          knowledge on topics I previously studied, and helped students clear up hazy
          new topics, so it was a win-win. I continued on assisting the department,
          and my students grew their knowledge with me. Now, my students are
          working for some of the highest paying tech firms, and I'm over here,
          continuing my learning and improving my knowledge, as I'm just fascinated by
          the possibilities this field opens up.

        <h2 class="home-title">What are my plans?</h2>
        <div class="home-text-container">
          As of right now, I'm registered in graduate level courses for the upcoming Fall
          2018, and I plan to continue my adventures as a teaching assistant.
          Broadly speaking, my plans are to keep on learning and achieving
          milestones. More specifically, if the right opportunities and ideas arise, I want
          to be an innovator and start many new, useful, and successful things that would
          help change the world. This is because I don't want to be just another
          brick in the wall, I want to build one.
