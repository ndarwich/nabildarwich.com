        <div class="home-featured-subtitle">
          For the final project in SWE 681 (Secure Software Design/Programming), I
          partnered with <a href="https://github.com/Hamza-Mughal/">Hamza-Mughal</a>
          to create a novel online <b>secure</b> multiplayer game called
          <a href="/pente">Pente</a>. The game is based off the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente">original strategy game</a> and
          application itself features user account creation and authentication.

            <div class="home-sub-block-text">
              The players have one minute each to place a White/Black piece
              on the board. The goal of the game is to either get 5 pieces of your color in a row
              (horizontally/vertically/diagonally), or make 5 captures of your opponent's
              pieces. The first player who meets one of these conditions wins the game,
              with their statistics getting updated in the leaderboard. After its end,
              the game along with its details can also be found in the
              <a href="/pente/completedGames">Completed Games</a> page.

              One of my favorite GMU Computer Science graduate courses is
              CS 672 (Computer Systems Performance Evaluation). By taking this course,
              I have learned very important laws that govern how computers are expected
              to behave. Computer systems do not behave arbitrarily; if a computer is slow,
              there is a physical reason why it is so, whether it's hardware or thread contention.
              On a smallroject, I created a website for a fictional online
              bookstore.

                  Knowledge comes in many file formats, and Nabil's books sells Text Books (.txt), Image Books (.png), Audio Books
                  (.mp3), Video Books (.mp4), and Miscellaneous Books (.zip/.ppt/.pdf). In order to boost customer satisfaction,
                  Nabil wants to ensure that consumers are getting the service they expect in a timely manner. And so, an executive
                  decision has to be made regarding whether to purchase more CPUs or more Disks for the server that hosts Nabil's Books.
