  <h1>Study Buddy</h1>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  Another problem on-campus students face is the need for a study room, only to
  find out another student is sitting in it. So, in order to ensure that the room
  is yours, and that other students don't camp in a study room, Study Buddy was
  invented. Study Buddy is Dorm Buddy's study room reservation system. With it,
  users can reserve study rooms up to one week in advance, guaranteeing that
  the room would be free when it's time to review for their exam.

      <h2>Study Rooms</h2>
      When Study Buddy is launched, a list of upcoming study room reservations
      for the week show up. Those reservations have all been created by the user,
      and the user can tap any one of them to view more details, or cancel it and
      free up the room for other students.

        <h3>Reservations</h3>
        Any user can reserve a study room. After tapping the "Reserve a room" button, the user is prompted to
        fill out a form with reservation details. The inputs in this form are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Title - A brief overview of what the reservation is about.</li>
          <li>
            Image - This is an optional icon users can upload and attach with their
            reservation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Location - Where the reservation will take place. Users must select a
            room number from this drop down list of study rooms in the building.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time - In here, users select a sequence of 15-minute timeslots
            that go with their reservation. Time slots selected by the user are
            highlighted in green while those in which the room is already occupied
            are in red. So, to avoid conflicts, red timeslots are not
            selectable. Also, users can only reserve a maximum of 2 hours per day, with
			the user interface and server prohibiting them from selecting any more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Description - This is where users get creative. In this text area, users
            are free to jot down notes regarding the topics they plan to cover during the
            study session.
          </li>
        </ul>
        After hitting the create button, the reservation can be seen in Study Buddy's
        main screen. The timeslots associated with the reservation will be highlighted
        in red for users who attempt to reserve the same room
