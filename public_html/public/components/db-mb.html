    <h2>Purpose</h2>
      Map Buddy was designed to aid students in their day to day navigation
      around campus, and even around the city! A common problem students face
      in the beginning of a semester, or when they are new to the campus, is
      that they don't know where different buildings are. That often leads to
      other problems, such as being late to pivotal first days of class, not
      knowing the existence of popular buildings, and so on. Map Buddy
      directly addresses those issues, helping students navigate seamlessly.
      There are two types of maps in Map Buddy: Interactive user friendly maps,
      and static local maps.

        <h2>Interactive Maps</h2>
        Interactive maps are Map Buddy's flexible user customized maps. Currently,
        there are two interactive maps: a city map and a campus map. Interactive
        maps use the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/">
        Google Maps Android SDK</a> to make map customization possible. When a
        map is first launched, users get to view and interact with the area,
        and they are also introduced to a set of predefined markers.
        <h3>Geolocation Markers</h3>
        As part of the app, interactive maps already come with static markers
        situated where hotspots lie. Such hotspots include a recreational center
        in the campus map, and a nearby shopping mall in the city map. The
        list of markers can be viewed by tapping the "View Markers" button, and users
        can tap on any marker to have their map automatically pan
        and zoom to it. If the user has their location data enabled, they can
        view where they are relative to the marker. If the user feels that
        a marker is not needed anymore, they can long tap its list item and the marker
        disappears after a confirmation. If the user wants to pin a new location,
        they can use the Add Marker interface, where all that is left is
        giving the marker a name and tapping its location in the map. The marker
        then becomes available in the user's list.

        <h2>Available Maps</h2>
        Under available maps, the user gets to see static local maps relevant
        to where they reside. For now, the available maps include a campus map
        of the student's university and a map of the user's dormitory floor. The
        user can select a local map and save it to their phone gallery if they wish.
        When saved, the user can navigate to the Dorm Buddy folder in their Android gallery
        and access the local map offline, at their convenience.
