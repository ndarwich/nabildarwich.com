      Nabil's Books is an online bookstore that serves books to millions of knoweledge seekers worldwide.
      The knowledge it serves comes in a variety of file formats and sizes, and a vast number of requests
      get processed concurrently by the bookstore. Over time, as its business
      model is to serve all types of knowledge for free regardless of location, Nabil's Books has gained enough popularity to
      become an internationally recognized monopoly. Due to its popularity, however, consumer traffic has started causing
      longer than expected download speeds, and many customers leave unsatisfied with the free service
      due to that. The founder of the bookstore, Nabil, wants to keep his customers happy, so he
      launches an investigation to find out the root cause of these latencies and how to address them.

      Knowledge comes in many forms, and many file formats as well. Nabil's Books is proud to serve
      books of common media formats, as well as wildcard file formats like .zip and .pptx. The following is a list
      of books served by Nabil's Books:

        </div>
        The original media type that Nabil's Books serves is Text Books. Nabil's Text Books contain a vast mountain of
        information, all written in Latin. To exemplify how much knowledge Nabil's Text Books have, the smallest
        Text Book, <a href="/books/getBook/text/5MB.txt">5MB.txt</a>, has 757,760 words. The average reading speed is 200
        words per minute, so it would take 63 hours to read that book alone.
