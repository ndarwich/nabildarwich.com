      Nabil's Books is an online bookstore that serves books to millions of knowledge seekers worldwide.
      The knowledge it serves comes in a variety of file formats and sizes, and a vast number of requests
      get processed concurrently by the bookstore. Over time, as its business
      model is to serve all types of knowledge for free regardless of location, Nabil's Books has gained enough popularity to
      become an world renowned. Due to its popularity, however, consumer traffic has started causing
      longer than expected download speeds, and many customers leave unsatisfied with the free service
      due to that. The founder of the bookstore, Nabil, wants to keep his customer base happy, so he
      launches an investigation to find out the root cause of these latencies and how to address them.

      Knowledge comes in many forms, and many file formats as well. Nabil's Books is proud to serve
      books of common media formats, as well as wildcard file formats like .zip and .pptx. The following is a list
      of books served by Nabil's Books:
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Text Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-text.png" alt="Nabil's Text Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        The original media type that Nabil's Books serves is Text Books. Nabil's Text Books contain a vast mountain of
        information, all written in Latin. To exemplify how much knowledge Nabil's Text Books have, the smallest
        Text Book, <a href="/books/getBook/text/5MB.txt">5MB.txt</a>, has 757,760 words. The average reading speed is 200
        words per minute, so it would take an average person 63 hours to read that book alone.
      </div>
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Image Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-image.png" alt="Nabil's Image Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        Sometimes, knowledge can be captured through images instead of text, and that is why
        Nabil's Image Books exist. Images can convey a lot of information; whether they are
        simple artwork or engineering graphs and models. The Image Books that are in stock
        show the colors lavender and green, and everything in between.
      </div>
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Audio Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-audio.png" alt="Nabil's Audio Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        To help pass time, whether it's waiting for an appointment or commuting to work, one
        can learn new information and become more knowledgeable through listening to an Audio Book.
        Nabil's Audio Books are there to make the most out of otherwise wasted time. One can play
        an Audio Book in the background, and any mindless task suddenly becomes a very productive
        one.
      </div>
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Video Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-video.png" alt="Nabil's Video Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        Video Books are the next type of media shared by the bookstore. Video Books are
        a mixture of Image Books (frames) and Audio Books (an audio track). Getting the best
        of both worlds comes at a storage cost however, as video books range in sizes
        from 45 MB to 119 MB. This high cost is examined more thoroughly in the experiment,
        as the founder considers  purchasing a separate disk to serve Video Books.

      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Miscellaneous Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-misc.png" alt="Nabil's Miscellaneous Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        Wildcard books that are not in any of the previous categories are considered Miscellaneous
        Books. The Miscellaneous Books that are currently in stock are .zip, .pptx, and .pdf files.
        Customers may download and analyze Zip Books to learn about file compression of different
        media, or they may go over the slides in Powerpoint Books to learn about virtual memory and caching.
        Either way, knowledge is always there.

    The Experiment
  </div>
  <div class="nb-shelf">
    From their descriptions, and due to the fact that they are all free, one can see why demand for
    Nabil's Books is so high. The high demand however causes the server to clog up and possibly crash when
    too many requests are being processed concurrently. Customers sometimes wait 30 seconds
    from the server before their Book download starts. The problem was seen by management, and it needed
    to be fixed. Should more CPUs be installed or should another disk be used to serve Video Books?
    This is what the research paper explores.
