      Nabil's Books is an online bookstore that serves books to millions of knowledge seekers worldwide.
      The knowledge it offers comes in a variety of file formats and sizes, and a vast number of requests
      get processed concurrently by the bookstore. Over time, as its business
      model is to serve all types of knowledge for free, regardless of availability, Nabil's Books has gained enough popularity to
      become world renowned. Due to its popularity, however, consumer traffic began to cause
      longer than expected download speeds, and many customers left frustrated with the free service
      due to that. The founder of the bookstore, Nabil, wants to make his bookworms happy, so he
      launches an investigation to determine the root cause of these latencies.

      Knowledge comes in many forms, and many file formats. Nabil's Books is proud to offer
      books of all common media formats one comes across in the web. These are the types of books
      Nabil's Books has in stock:
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Text Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-text.png" alt="Nabil's Text Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        The original media type that Nabil's Books provides is Text Books. Nabil's Text Books contain a vast amount of
        data, all written in Latin. To exemplify how much knowledge Nabil's Text Books have, the smallest
        Text Book, <a href="/books/getBook/text/5MB.txt">5MB.txt</a>, has 757,760 words. The average reading speed is 200
        words per minute, so it would take an average person 63 hours to read that book alone!
      </div>
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Image Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-image.png" alt="Nabil's Image Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        Sometimes, knowledge can be captured through images instead of text, and that is why
        Nabil's Image Books exist. Images convey lot of information; whether they are
        art pieces, analytical charts, or engineering designs. The Image Books that are in stock
        show two colors, lavender and green. However, the images are so detailed that virtually every
        color in between is captured through the pixels within.

      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Audio Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-audio.png" alt="Nabil's Audio Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        To help pass time, whether it's waiting for a doctor to show up or commuting to work, one
        can learn new information and become more informed through listening to an Audio Book.
        Nabil's Audio Books are there to make the most out of otherwise wasted time. One can play
        an Audio Book in the background, and any mindless task suddenly becomes highly productive.
        The Audio Books that are available contain cryptic sounds left by aliens.
      </div>
      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Video Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-video.png" alt="Nabil's Video Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        Video Books are the next type of media shared by the bookstore. Video Books are
        a mixture of Image Books (frames) and Audio Books (audio tracks). Getting the best
        of both worlds comes at a storage cost however, as video books range in sizes
        from 45 MB to 119 MB. This high cost is examined more thoroughly in the experiment,
        as the founder considers  purchasing a separate disk to serve Video Books. The Video Books
        that are available show an alien and his natural lifestyle, working at 3 AM to finish this
        project.

      <div class="nb-shelf-subshelf">
        <div class="nb-shelf-subtitle">Miscellaneous Books</div>
        <div class="nb-shelf-img nb-float-left">
          <img src="/img/book-misc.png" alt="Nabil's Miscellaneous Books" class="displayable-photo" />
        </div>
        Wildcard books that are not in any of the previous categories are considered Miscellaneous
        Books. These book formats are very useful for knowledge transfer and presentation. The Miscellaneous Books that are currently in stock are .zip, .pptx, and .pdf files.
        Customers may download and analyze Zip Books to learn about file compression of different
        media, or they may go over the slides in Powerpoint Books to learn about virtual memory and caching, a topic explored in CS 367.

    The Experiment
  </div>
  <div class="nb-shelf">
    From their descriptions, and due to the fact that they are all free, one can see why demand for
    Nabil's Books is so high. The high demand, however, causes the server to clog up and crash when
    traffic is too high. Customers sometimes may wait 30 seconds
    from the server before their Book download starts when 1,000 people are downloading concurrently. The problem was seen by management, and it had
    to be fixed. Should more CPUs be installed or should another disk be used to serve Video Books?
    The paper explores this very question, and more!
