      <h2>Background</h2>
      In late May 2016, while thinking about a new game to add to my collection,
      an idea popped into my head to change the way Tetris is played and make the
      game more challenging. The initial idea was to have pieces spawn in the
      middle of the board, with users being required to clear lines either on the
      top or the bottom of the board, with the direction pieces fall to switching
      after one is placed. So, I got started developing this new Java game, and
      decided to call it TetrisWorld. As I was developing, I wondered, as the
      board is a 2-D grid, and changing the gravitational direction of the pieces
      is only a matter of mathematical manipulation, why not expand the idea and
      make users clear lines in all 4 directions? Moreover, how could I
      incentivize the player to change the gravitational direction? The answer is
      the basis for TetrisWorld, and it is to have users clear squares rather than
      lines. In the following weeks, I was writing code for the game and its GUI,
      designing its different pieces and pages along the way. When TetrisWorld was
      finished, I wanted to expand it even more, and I wanted to learn how games
      are developed in the web (flash). And so, I downloaded Adobe Animate CC,
      learned the programming language ActionScript, and got started on developing
      TETRIWORLD.

      <h2>Description and Gameplay</h2>
      TETRIWORLD is a block puzzle game inspired by Tetris. The objective of the
      game is to stay alive by clearing outer squares as pieces are falling. In
      the game, arrow keys move the current piece in the arrow's direction. The
      arrow key opposite to the current gravity rotates a piece clockwise. Hitting
      the Z and X keys rotates a piece as well, clockwise and counterclockwise
      respectively. A piece can be saved for future use using the shift key, which
      substitutes the current piece with one that is already held. The Ctrl key
      changes the gravitational shift of the board, and can only be used after a
      piece is placed to prevent indefinite gravity changes. Esc pauses the game,
      and likewise, can only be used after a piece is placed to prevent indefinite
      pausing. To pardon mistakes, left clicking a piece removes it completely
      from the board. The game is over when the stack piles to the 4x4 square
      pieces initially spawn in. There are different difficulties for TETRIWORLD,
      with each having different starting gravitational speeds, number of gravity
      changes (Ctrl) per piece, and number of undos (mouse clicks) per game.

      <h2>Game Modes</h2>

        <div class="tw-game-mode">
          <h3>Classic Mode</h3>
          <img src="../img/tetriworld-classic.png" />
          <p>
            Classic Mode is the original version of the game. The goal of this mode is
            the same as that of TetrisWorld, which is to stay alive by clearing outer
            squares. In here, however, users are able to submit their score once a
            game is over. The score, as well as the username, number of squares
            cleared, and date achieved get stored in a server that the game pulls data
            from. Being in the top 10 ensures that your name will be seen in-game,
            otherwise, all submitted scores are available under the leaderboards tab
            on top of the game.

          <h3>Challenge Mode</h3>
          <img src="../img/tetriworld-challenge.png" />
          <p>
            Challenge Mode involves different variations of TETRIWORLD. The challenges
            have been submitted by the TETRIWORLD community, and feature different
            playing pieces, different starting boards, different spawn areas, and even
            different objectives. There are two types of challenges: survival and
            timed. For survival challenges, there is no objective, and the goal is to
            score the highest possible score given the challenge's layout. For
            timed challenges, a goal is stated for the player to meet before a time
            limit is up. The objective here is to complete the objective as fast as
            possible before time expires. The user can check their status when they
            pause the challenge.

          <h3>Create Mode</h3>
          <img src="../img/tetriworld-create.png" />
          <p>
            In Create Mode, you get to create your own challenges! Create mode
            features the ability to place starting pieces for a challenge and make
            a custom board. In the settings box for create mode, the user can set
            more criteria for the challenge, such as the pieces that will spawn in the
            game, where those pieces spawn, time constraints for timed challenges,
            squares that count, free tiles necessary to meet objectives, the type
            of challenge it is, and more details. The creator can also test out their
            challenge, and when it's published, it becomes directly available
            in Challenge Mode.
