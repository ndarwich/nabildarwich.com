        I'm Nabil Darwich, a student eager to learn. As a brief non-technical
        background of me, I like exploring new places and living spontaneously (but carefully).
        In my free time, when it's nice outside, I like to go out and either exercise
        or meet up with my friends. Otherwise, I stay indoors and write code
        while enjoying some soothing music, or sometimes I watch very popular older
        movies. Two of my favorite movies include <i>Blade Runner (1984</i>) and <i>The Matrix (1999).</i>
        On the other hand, my favorite music is rock music, with bands like Dire Straits
        and Guns N' Roses topping my list. Albums like <i>Brothers in Arms (1985)</i> are
        just perfect. To learn more about me, check out my

      <div class="faq-text-container">
        I'm a software developer, meaning I write code to create useful computer
        programs. The programs I develop range from ones that allow for robot
        movement with keyboard arrows to this very website. My intent when
        writing software is innovation. I want to solve unsolved problems and
        build things that have never been built before. But most importantly,
        I want each program I make to have a purpose. Whether it is
        to refresh my knowledge or help address a world problem, I use each
        program as a step forward towards my goal of being innovative and
        selfless. That being said, writing code is my passion, and it is
        what keeps me productive. To view samples of my published works, you

      <h2 class="faq-section-title">Why do I do it?</h2>
      <div class="faq-text-container">
        The reason I stay involved in Computer Science is that with it, there
        is no limit; I can develop things as far as my imagination goes. That's
        right, the sky used to be a limit, but we managed to surpass it,
        sent a man to the moon, and even a car to Mars, because why not?
        Now we are able to pack 100 million transistors in a square millimeter,
        and that number is only going to double every 18 months. We are also
        advancing in quantum computer research, with the devices having the
        potential to solve problems we never thought possible.
        <h3>Do I have any setbacks?</h3>
        Of course, there are many days where I ask myself whether or not this
        was the right decision to make. Those days are especially frequent
        when I dedicate hours of my time dealing with an issue that could have
        been solved in 10 lines of code. Some days, I think about the negative
        effects Computer Science had on my social life and physical health,
        such as choosing to spend more time coding over friends, and not
        exercising as I optimally should, and that leads me deeper down the
        hole of regretting my decision to choose Computer Science.
        <h3>Why do I still do it?</h3>
        Because there is a lot of gratification in having an innovation that
        you engineered that does work and solves the problem you were trying
        to solve. Computer Science is an engineering field made for innovation,
        and innovation is what leads to human progress and development. I aim
        to be an innovator, and want to solve major problems the world is facing.
        The world is great thanks to innovators, from those who discovered how
        to make and manipulate fires, to recent pioneers like Thomas Edison
        and the great Elizabeth White.

      <h2 class="faq-section-title">How do I do it?</h2>
      <div class="faq-text-container">
        Prior to starting my undergrad, I had no experience writing code. In
        fact, the only reason I decided to study Computer Science at the time was
        the simple fact that I loved messing around with computers, and I
        was my family's free tech support specialist. So, I chose Computer Science as my major and
        took at least 3 courses every semester that are relevant to the field
        and are designated to build up my knowledge. After my first successful
        year, I wanted to give back, and help students just like I was helped
        when I was new to the field. So, I applied to become a teaching assistant,
        and made it in the best CS department to ever exist! My first semester as a teaching assistant
        was invaluable, as I had over 1,500 contributions in the shared online
        forum, and I made unforgettable friendships with the students I helped.
        That spirit of selflessness was very rewarding, as it helped me refresh my
        knowledge on topics I previously studied, and helped my students clear up hazy
        new topics, so it was a win-win. I continued on assisting the department,
        and my students grew their knowledge with me. Now, my students are
        working for some of the highest paying tech firms, and I'm over here,
        continuing my learning and improving my knowledge, as I'm just fascinated by
        the possibilities this field opens up.

      <h2 class="faq-section-title">What are my plans?</h2>
      <div class="faq-text-container">
        As of right now, I'm registered in 4 graduate level courses, and I am
        continuing my adventures as a teaching assistant, as a graduate one this time.
        Broadly speaking, my plans are to keep on learning and achieving
        milestones. More specifically, if the right opportunities and ideas arise, I want
        to be an innovator and make an impact on the world somehow.
